# EmployWise React App

## Overview
EmployWise is a React application that integrates with the Reqres API to perform basic user management functions, including authentication, user listing, editing, updating, and deletion.

## Features

### Level 1: Authentication Screen
- Created a basic authentication screen where users can log in using credentials.
- API Endpoint: `POST /api/login` with email and password in the body.
- Credentials:
  - **Email**: eve.holt@reqres.in
  - **Password**: cityslicka
- On successful login, the token is stored in local storage, and the user is navigated to the Users List page.

### Level 2: List All Users
- After logging in, a paginated list of users is displayed.
- API Endpoint: `GET /api/users?page=1`
- Users' first name, last name, and avatar are displayed in a structured layout.
- Implemented pagination to navigate through different pages of users.

### Level 3: Edit, Delete, and Update Users
- Each user in the list has options to **Edit** or **Delete** their details.
- **Edit:**
  - Clicking Edit opens a form pre-filled with the user's data.
  - Allows updating the user's first name, last name, and email.
  - API Endpoint: `PUT /api/users/{id}`
- **Delete:**
  - Clicking Delete removes the user from the list.
  - API Endpoint: `DELETE /api/users/{id}`
- Appropriate success or error messages are displayed based on the outcome of each operation.
